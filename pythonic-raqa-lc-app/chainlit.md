# Pythonic RAGA with LangChain & Pinecone

This application leverages Chainlit, OpenAI, LangChain, Pinecone and Hugging Face to build a basic RAQA (Retrieval Augmented Question Answering) application based on a Pinecone index containing documents with arxiv papers about nuclear fission.

Await for the `The application is ready !` message before starting to use the app.
